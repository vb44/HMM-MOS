# Moving Object Segmentation in Point Cloud Data using Hidden Markov Models

We propose a novel learning-free approach to segment moving objects in point cloud data.
The foundation of teh approach lies in modelling each voxel using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and probabilistically integrating beliefs into a global map using an HMM filter.

This is the open-source implementation of the proposed approach. 
The code is portable, easy to understand, and modify.
